              Getting healthy or living a healthy lifestyle has been getting a lot of media attention in the past few years.  Obesity has been hailed as the new 
			  epidemic western disease that we all have to fight. To avoid living with the disease, doctors agree that starting young with healthy habits can have lasting beneficial 
			  effects for everyone.  Young adults are of particular interest because of their lifestyle.  These days, younger people are partying harder, perhaps due to popular media 
			  promoting the unhealthy rock and roll lifestyle as cool.  This makes the jobs of doctors and parents that much harder.&nbsp;<br /><br />
              In more recent years, the public has seen more and more celebrities jumping into the healthy lifestyle bandwagon.  It is important to have these 
			  popular people support a healthy lifestyle because people look up to them.  Experts agree that the best health habits should be practiced while we are still young, 
			  and college students or young adults can effectively benefit from it.<br />
