				<img id="photosHealthyF" src="images/photoFitness2.jpg" alt="Healthy habits"  />
				<p class="HealthyPara">Want to feel better, have more energy and perhaps even live longer? Look no further than exercise. The health benefits 
				of regular exercise and physical activity are hard to ignore. And the benefits of exercise are yours for the taking, regardless of your age, sex 
				or physical ability. Need more convincing to exercise? Check out these seven ways exercise can improve your life.</p>

				<div class="div-F2" ><p class="pageHeaders"><em>Running </em></p>
				<img id="photosHealthyF" src="images/photoFitness3.jpg" alt="Healthy habits"  />
				<p class="HealthyPara">Many runners probably begin their running program with a physical goal foremost in their minds, like losing weight or toning
				 their legs. These are definitely some potential benefits that come from running, but they’re not the only ones. One of the greatest benefits of a 
				 runner’s lifestyle is that it strongly contributes to overall health in so many ways. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="div-F3" ><p class="pageHeaders"><em>Pool Workouts</em></p>
				<img id="photosHealthyF" src="images/photoFitness6.jpg" alt="Healthy habits"  />
				<p class="HealthyPara">The average thirty minute pool workout burns approximately 300 calories. It takes the elimination of 3600 calories to burn off
				 a pound of body fat. A minimum three to four times per week pool workout is recommended, so a mere three to four weeks will result in measurable weight loss. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="div-F4" ><p class="pageHeaders"><em>Cycling </em></p>
				<img id="photosHealthyF" src="images/photoFitness5.jpg" alt="Healthy habits"  />
				<p class="HealthyPara">Need your grey matter to sparkle? Then get pedalling. Researchers from Illinois University found that a ﬁve percent improvement 
				in cardio-respiratory ﬁtness from cycling led to an improvement of up to 15 percent in mental tests. That’s because cycling helps build new brain cells in 
				the hippocampus – the region responsible for memory, which deteriorates from the age of 30. </p>
