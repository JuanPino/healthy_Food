            <p class="margin"><strong>Why are these healthy habits important?</strong><br /> Maintaining good health habits is a secret of every happy man. There is an
			 old saying that "Health is Wealth." If your health is good then you are good, if you are good then you can work properly, and if you can work properly then 
			 you get wealth.<br /><br />
              <strong> Why Should I Make Healthy Food Choices? </strong><br />To truly understand the importance of establishing healthy eating habits, you need to ask yourself 
			  a very simple question: “Why do humans need to eat?” (Note the use of the word “need,” not “want.”) Simply put, humans need to eat to supply their bodies with 
			  nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins and minerals) that then supply the body with fuel for energy, aid in tissue growth and repair, act in various 
			  biochemical reactions, and much, much more. The basic need for food is pretty simple and could be compared to putting gas in your car. If you put the right fuel 
			  into your car, it will spring to life with a single turn of the key and run smoothly for many years, but if you put soda pop and sugar in your gas tank, it’s going 
			  to ruin your car. In this sense, your car and your body are very much alike. They both run well on the right kind of fuel, but will deteriorate over time if you neglect
			   their basic fueling needs.
			  &nbsp;<br /><br />
              <strong>Why Should I Strive for a Healthy Lifestyle?</strong><br />It’s a lot of work to eat healthy; it takes discipline and isn’t always fun, so why bother?
			   At some point in your life, you will be faced with the realization that the health of your body is the determining factor for what kind of lifestyle you can 
			   lead. Just like a smoker faces a possible future of emphysema and lung cancer, if you neglect healthy eating habits you not only face a possible future of
			    being overweight or obese, you also run the risk of depression, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, bowel complications and much more.<br /><br />
