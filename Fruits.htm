				<p class="HealthyPara">Fruits are not only delicious but healthful too. Rich in vitamins A and C, plus folate and other essential nutrients, 
				they may help prevent heart disease and stroke, control blood pressure and cholesterol, prevent some types of cancer and guard against vision loss.
				Vitamins that promote good health, you may wonder if you can just pop supplements.</p>

				<img id="photosHealthyF" src="images/photoFruits3.jpg" alt="Healthy habits"  />
				<p class="HealthyPara">Fruit salad is a dish consisting of various kinds of fruit, sometimes served in a liquid, either in their own juices or a syrup. 
				When served as an appetizer or as a dessert, a fruit salad is sometimes known as a fruit cocktail or fruit cup. In different forms fruit salad can be 
				served as an appetizer, a side-salad, or a dessert Common ingredients used in fruit salads include strawberries, pineapple, honeydew, watermelon. </p>

				<div class="div-F3" ><p class="pageHeaders"><em>Banana, Mango & Ice cream</em></p>
				<img id="photosHealthyF" src="images/photoFruits6.jpg" alt="Healthy habits"  />
				<p class="HealthyPara">Fruit cocktail is often sold canned and is a staple of cafeterias, but can also be made fresh. The use of the word "cocktail" 
				in the name does not mean that it contains alcohol, but refers to the secondary definition "An appetizer made by combining pieces of food, such as fruit
				 or seafood". Fruit cocktail is sometimes used to make pruno. </p>

				<div class="div-F4" ><p class="pageHeaders"><em>Mixed Fruit Salad 2 </em></p>
				<img id="photosHealthyF" src="images/photoFruits5.jpg" alt="Healthy habits"  />
				<p class="HealthyPara">nice and sweet, with a little hint of vanilla lusciousness. So simple to make, and you can use any fruit you want—melon chunks,
				 orange pieces, apples, pears…the works. And it’s perfect not just for Easter brunch, but for baby or wedding showers, special lunches…or just a weekday 
				 that calls for a beautiful bowl of color. </p>
