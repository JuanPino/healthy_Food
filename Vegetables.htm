				<p class="HealthyPara">Vegetables are most often consumed as salads or cooked in savory or salty dishes, while culinary fruits are usually sweet and used 
				for desserts, but it is not the universal rule. Therefore, For example, some people 
				consider mushrooms to be vegetables even though they are not biologically plants.</p>

				<div class="div-V2" ><p class="pageHeaders"><em>Stir Fried Meal </em></p>
				<img id="photosHealthyF" src="images/photoVeg3.jpg" alt="Healthy habits"  />
				<p class="HealthyPara">The secret to good stir frying is not to put too much in the wok at the one time, if you do, the vegetables will sweat instead 
				of frying. This recipe's for two people but if you're cooking for four, don't dump twice as much in, do it in two batches. Stir frying is a pair of
				 Chinese cooking techniques for preparing food in a wok: chǎo and bào. The term stir-fry was introduced into the English language by Buwei Yang Chao,
				 in her book How to Cook and Eat in Chinese. </p>

				<div class="div-V3" ><p class="pageHeaders"><em>Chapel Hill Creamery</em></p>
				<img id="photosHealthyF" src="images/photoVeg4.jpg" alt="Healthy habits"  />
				<p class="HealthyPara">Although the vegetables are incredible on their own, sauteed in a bit of olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper, I added 
				a few things to create something new and add to the overall yumminess of the dish. The red wine vinegar adds a brightness to the dish while the 
				sugar brings out the sweetness in the tomatoes. Finished off with some fresh basil and a bit more feta cheese and you've got yourself quite a meal. 
				So with these incredibly fresh ingredients at the ready, there are tons of delicious dishes just begging to be made. </p>

				<div class="div-V4" ><p class="pageHeaders"><em>Kacang Phool </em></p>
				<img id="photosHealthyF" src="images/photoVeg6.jpg" alt="Healthy habits"  />
				<p class="HealthyPara">breakfast galore for  home made Kacang Phool and Chappati. know it is a popular dish in Johor and Singapore. I Google 
				for the recipe and was stumped as there are so many recipes on the said dish and the ingredients used differ greatly that I am not sure which I should use. </p>
